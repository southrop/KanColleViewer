This is a browser of sorts for KanColle.
It's a tool to make playing KanColle easier.


### About the Project
The tool uses WPF's web browser control to display the game and FiddlerCore to capture communication data.
Obviously, the tool does not modify the information or send any new infromation to the KanColle servers at all.

* Summary of all available fleets and the shipgirls in them
* Repair and construction dock status and notifications for when the timers end
* Expedition status and notifications for when the timers end
* Screenshots
* Mute audio

#### Planned Features
* A lot


### System Requirements
* Windows 8 or higher
* .NET Framework 4.5

[@Grabacr07](https://twitter.com/Grabacr07), the developer, uses Windows 8.1 Pro and Visual Studio Premium 2013 to develop and build this.

While it will run on Windows 7, popup notifications for Expeditions and Construction/Repair timers will cause the program to crash. This is on the list of things to be fixed.
The program has only been confirmed to work on Windows 8 or above, so if there are any issues on Windows 7, please report it.
